    description: "The Škoda Enyaq iV is the Czech automaker's first purpose-built electric vehicle, representing a significant milestone in the brand's history. Built on the Volkswagen Group's MEB (Modularer E-Antriebs-Baukasten) platform dedicated to electric vehicles and shared with models like the Volkswagen ID.4 and Audi Q4 e-tron, the Enyaq features a distinctive SUV design that balances contemporary Škoda styling cues with aerodynamic efficiency. Measuring approximately 4.65 meters in length, the Enyaq positions itself as a C-segment SUV with interior space comparable to larger vehicles thanks to the packaging advantages of the dedicated electric platform. Available in multiple powertrain configurations, the Enyaq lineup includes rear-wheel drive single-motor variants (Enyaq 50, 60, 80) and all-wheel drive dual-motor versions (Enyaq 80x, RS), with battery capacities ranging from 52 kWh to 82 kWh (net) providing WLTP ranges between approximately 340 and 510 kilometers depending on configuration. Power outputs range from 148 horsepower in the base model to 299 horsepower in the performance-oriented RS variant, which can accelerate from 0-100 km/h in 6.2 seconds. Charging capabilities include AC charging at up to 11 kW and DC fast charging at up to 125 kW (or 135 kW in updated models), allowing an 80% charge in approximately 38 minutes under ideal conditions. The interior features a minimalist, modern design centered around a 13-inch central touchscreen complemented by an optional head-up display with augmented reality functionality. A unique feature is Škoda's 'Design Selection' approach, which replaces traditional trim levels with interior themes inspired by modern living environments, each featuring distinct materials, colors, and features. In 2021, the lineup expanded to include the Enyaq Coupé iV, featuring a sloping roofline, standard panoramic glass roof, and enhanced aerodynamics resulting in slightly improved range. The Enyaq represents Škoda's vision for modern, practical electric mobility, combining family-friendly space and functionality with zero-emission driving and the brand's traditional emphasis on value, utility, and thoughtful features."
