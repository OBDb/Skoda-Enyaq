    description: "The Škoda Enyaq (originally introduced as Škoda Enyaq iV) is the Czech automaker's first purpose-built electric vehicle, representing a significant milestone in the brand's history. Built on the Volkswagen Group's MEB (Modularer E-Antriebs-Baukasten) platform dedicated to electric vehicles and shared with models like the Volkswagen ID.4 and Audi Q4 e-tron, the Enyaq features a distinctive SUV design that balances contemporary Škoda styling cues with aerodynamic efficiency. Measuring approximately 4.65 meters in length, the Enyaq positions itself as a C-segment SUV with interior space comparable to larger vehicles thanks to the packaging advantages of the dedicated electric platform. The name is derived from the Irish name Enya, originating from the Gaelic word 'eithne', meaning 'essence, spirit or principle'. Production commenced in November 2020 at the Škoda plant in Mladá Boleslav, Czech Republic. Available in multiple powertrain configurations, the Enyaq lineup includes rear-wheel drive single-motor variants (Enyaq 50, 60, 80) and all-wheel drive dual-motor versions (Enyaq 80x, RS), with battery capacities ranging from 52 kWh to 77 kWh (usable) providing WLTP ranges between approximately 340 and 510 kilometers depending on configuration. Power outputs range from 109 kW in the base model to 225 kW in the performance-oriented RS variant. Charging capabilities include AC charging at up to 11 kW and DC fast charging at up to 125 kW. The interior features a minimalist, modern design centered around a 13-inch central touchscreen complemented by an optional head-up display with augmented reality functionality. A unique feature is Škoda's 'Design Selection' approach, which replaces traditional trim levels with interior themes inspired by modern living environments."
